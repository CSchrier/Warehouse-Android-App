# warehouseapplication

This repository is used soley to share code between multiple computers I use for developement. This is the most up to date android app client.

Uses are to record locations of palleted bins within a warehouse via communication with the warehouse server program located on a seperate device.

Ability to add/delete/move bins as well as audit aisles, and search for specific assets

This is in use with in-development pages running within the app that maybe depreciated or be meant for future updates.
